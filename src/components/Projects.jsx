                            Zombie Siege is a competitive PvE wave-survival game where players team up to fend off endless
                            hordes of zombies, moving up through the ranks and salvaging loot to upgrade their gear.

                        <p>
                            Zombie Siege started off as a personal project to learn Java and Paper/SpigotAPI â€” but eventually,
                            it found a player base that wanted to see it grow. So, it became more than an experiment.

                        <p>
                            Zombie Siege is built on a stack using Java, PaperAPI for Minecraft server development,
                            MongoDB for storage, GlitchTip for error tracking, and GitHub for version control. Production
                            is hosted on GalaxyMC; dev is self-hosted on DigitalOcean with Pterodactyl.

                        <p>
                            A1 Pools needed a simple, professional online presence to showcase their services and attract
                            new customers. The goal was to create just that - something that looks good and works well.

                            A1 Pools was built using Next.js for the frontend, with an assortment of
                            addons - such as TailwindCSS for styling, animation libraries for effects, and
                            Vercel for hosting.
